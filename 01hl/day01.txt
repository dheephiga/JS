JAVASCRIPT ENGINE:
1. create two files index.html and script.js
2. In the html, build the backbone from !DOCTYPE 
using tab space and inside the body type <script> tag
<script>".\script.js"<\script>
3. Installed a V8 engine that is node js and included it as
a path variable. Just type node -v in the cmd to make
sure it is installed since it returns a version number
4. Now back to VScode terminal typing node followed by 
the filename, which is script.js here, got error initially
gotta restart lets see.
5.
